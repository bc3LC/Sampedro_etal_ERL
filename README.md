## Abstract
Reducing within-region income inequality is a global priority that needs to be urgently addressed to promote human development and ensure global population meets basic living standards. This could potentially lead to higher energy-related emissions by lower-income consumers, creating some conflicts with climate change mitigation objectives. Using an enhanced version of the Global Change Analysis Model, we observe that differences in energy and food demand across wealthier and poorer deciles largely decrease in alternative Paris-compliant scenarios where within-region income inequality is reduced. 
The projected higher energy demand slightly increases the regional carbon prices required by each region to achieve existing national emission targets. While these price effects are moderate and have minor effect on the achievement of the climate pledges, they would be concentrated in some developing regions, and would need to be considered to ensure that meeting climate targets do not unfairly affect lower-income consumers.
